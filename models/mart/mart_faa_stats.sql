/*
In a table `mart_faa_stats.sql` we want to see **for each airport over all time**:

-- *(optional) how many unique airplanes travelled on average*

-- *(optional) how many unique airlines were in service  on average* 

-- add city, country and name of the airport


-- unique number of departures connections, how many flights were planned, cancelled, diverted in total (departures)
-- unique number of arrival connections, how many flight were planned, cancelled, diverted in total (arrivals)
